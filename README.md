# ansible-init
Simple shell script to init an Ansible directory.

Just do:

```bash
$ sudo mv ansible-init.sh /usr/local/sbin/
$ ansible-init /path/to/my-awesome-project
$ cd /path/to/my-awesome-project
```

And start coding your infrastructure. 

Please note that this is my way to doing this, so don't start yelling at me if you're not ok with it.
